# TTN_Scanner_SONOFF
Arduino code for SONOFF S20 mains switch (ESP8266) - to automatically switch on TTN gateway if WiFi is present

To complete this hack, you need
- SONOFF S20 Mains switch
- USB to Serial TTL adapter (for 3.3v)
- A 3.3v linear regulator (N.B. The standard USB to Serial adaptor cannot supply enough power for the LEDs)
- Some dupont connectors
- PC with Arduino / ESP8266 software installed
